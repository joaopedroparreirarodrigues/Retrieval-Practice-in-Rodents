# Retrieval Practice in Rodents
##### _Modelling the testing effect in mice_

# What is the retrieval practice?
As APA puts it: "_The finding that taking a test on previously studied material leads to better retention than does restudying that material for an equivalent amount of time._"

# What is the aim of the project?
The testing effect is widely known in the context of studies with humans. However the information regarding this topic is lacking when the subject in focus is mice (citation needed)

# The goal of the model:
If the Restudy group performs better than the control, the restudy practice was well modeled on the experimental task. 
If the test group performs better than the restudy group on the final test, there will be a test effect. 
These are the results that we want to model.
